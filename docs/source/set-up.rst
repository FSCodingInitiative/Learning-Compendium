Tech-Stack
==========

In general the word "tech-stack" can be defined as "*a combination of programming
languages, frameworks, and tools that developers use*" in order to create their
challenge :cite:p:`perfectial.2021`. This can be Python, JavaScript, R, Docker,
Draw.io, and so on and so forth. Basically, every tool you use in order to fulfill
your task. In the here following chapter we will introduce some tools to you,
explain them a bit and give you some hints where you can start researching them
a bit more if you should be interested. Overall, a good Tech-Stack is a good
thing to have.

Draw.io
#######

`Draw.io <draw.io>`_ is a tool for an easy creation of flowcharts. You can download
it as a desktop app for free and use it how you want. What one mostly does with it,
is to create flowcharts of code. Normally every documentation of a repository or
a project should have one. It eases the access to understand what the general idea
of a project is. Some good tutorials can be found here :cite:p:`drawio.2021`.

Python
######

Everyone of you have already probably heard of Python. It is a well known
programming language which is mostly used for Machine Learning, or in less
fancier terms, predictive statistics. Its syntax is quite accessible and, after
some interaction, understandable (*We know, in the beginning its a lot to comprehend,
but head over to the* :ref:`Beginners` *section to get a good introduction into Python*).
Python is an open-source project and it is always developed further and further.
In general, there are always new version of Python on the market. In the time of
writing this section, the current version is **3.9.6** :cite:p:`python.2021`.

**Things to add:**

#. Always use an older version because of compatibility
#. System Python
#. Virtual env
#. Docker
#. Usage
