Beginners
=========

This chapter is divided into the different programming languages, which will
be introduced here (e.g. :ref:`Python`, :ref:`R`, :ref:`JavaScript`). All of those
little sections will give you a little introduction into those tools, as well
as some hints about the usage of the software. Most importantly we want you to support us
in rewriting the section, adding references and erase mistakes. The benefit for you is that you will
understand the frameworks or code even better as you start expressing it in simple words. We can
tell from our working experience that every code snippet needs to be documented which helps everyone.
