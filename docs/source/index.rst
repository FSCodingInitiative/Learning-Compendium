================================================
Welcome to the FS Coding Initiative!
================================================

This repository belongs to the Coding Initiative of the
`Frankfurt School of Finance and Management <https://www.frankfurt-school.de/home>`_.
This repository will grow over time, so make sure to check in on it every once
in a while.

However, the main idea of this repository is to create content for different
level of coding. It contains a section for :ref:`Beginners`, where the basics of
Python will be explained. Second a :ref:`Medium` section, where a bit more deeper
ideas about programming in general an Python as explained. The last part will be
the :ref:`Advanced` section. Within this section some programs might be explained,
but mostly it contains challenges which you have to fulfill in a team or by your
own.

**Before you start digging in**, please shortly read the :ref:`Tech-Stack` section. 
It will go briefly over the things you should know, when you are enrolled in
a master program at Frankfurt School or alternatives if you are not.
