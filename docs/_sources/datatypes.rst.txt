Datatypes
==========


Like in every other programming language it is possible to manipulate data and variables of different data types,
which are part of numeric, string or boolean types. In the following section it is explained how you are able to 
use these datatypes to code a solution for your problem.

Integer
--------
Integers are whole numbers like 1, 5, 3784, 1000000 and with them we are able to perform simple mathematical calculations.
We can add, subtract, multiply, divide, square or even take a root.
In Python 3, there is effectively no limit to how long an integer value can be. Of course, it is constrained by 
the amount of memory your system has, as are all things, but beyond that an integer can be as long as you need it to be.
Saying so, here are some examples for integer calculations:

- add ==> print(3 + 3)
- subtract ==> print(7 - 4)
- multiply ==> print(7 * 8)
- divide ==> print(100/10)
- square ==> print(3**3)
- root ==> print(3**(0.5)) 


Float
--------
The float type in Python represents the floating point number. Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.
For example are numbers like 10.4, 3492.892123 or 3.1415 floating numbers and you are able to the same maths as with integers.

String

Boolean

List

Dictionary

Tuple
